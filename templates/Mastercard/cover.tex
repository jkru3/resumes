I'm writing to express my strong interest in the Software Engineer I position with Ekata. As a Computer Science graduate from the University of Washington with experience in data processing systems and cloud technologies, I'm exited by the opportunity to contribute to Ekata's Identity Engine and help power digital economy that Mastercard is building.

I believe my recent experience as a Software Engineering Intern at Clean Power Research meets your qualifications. There, I designed and implemented a scalable, fault-tolerant .NET application and extended orchestration infrastructure using AWS Lambda to connect with containerized applications. From that, I gained practical knowledge of working with large datasets and developing high-performance solutions, which would be valuable for working with Ekata's data processing systems.

I also co-foundeed of Clearvote, where I gained hands-on experience with many technologies relevant to your position. This included deploying a high-availability RESTful API supporting over 3,000 users, seting up and managing a DynamoDB NoSQL database, and working extensively with other AWS services like Lambda, EC2, and S3

What particularly excites me about this role is the opportunity to work with Scala, Apache Spark, and machine learning systems at scale. Though my experience has been primarily with Java, TypeScript, and C\#, I have a strong foundation in strongly-typed languages and am eager to apply my algorithm design and problem-solving skills to learn Scala and contribute to your Graph and Tools Team. My values also align with Ekata's mission of linking digital transactions to the humans behind them.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my skills and enthusiasm align with Ekata's goals and how I can contribute to your team's success.
