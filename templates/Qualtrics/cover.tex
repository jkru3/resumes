It is 2025, and the world is racing to develop artificial intelligence. I sought out Qualtrics as a company focused on enhancing human experiences, not just replacing them.

Under the tutelage of Professor Yejin Choi, I co-authored a submission for ProtoQA, a commonsense reasoning benchmark in the NLP field optimizing for predicting human responses to Family Feud-style questions (which we appropriately dubbed "Steve Harvey Bot").

These technical skills carried over to a side project I founded called Clearvote, which used an NLP system to make the nuances of local politics more tangible. Using GPT-4, we built a pipeline that translates political rhetoric into clear, quantifiable metrics that anyone can understand. The challenge wasn't just technical—we spent weeks exploring human psychology, ethics, and political science to design an AI system optimized for decision-making at the ballot box. At its peak during last year’s election, Clearvote reached over 3,000 users.

For me, working at Qualtrics means the opportunity to continue building AI systems that amplify human experiences. My background in PyTorch, TensorFlow, and AWS, along with my ongoing work with Kubernetes, Prometheus, and Grafana, has given me the technical foundation to contribute to your ML infrastructure and operations. As a machine learning engineer, it would be a privilege to grow my skills and collaborate in creating AI-driven experiences.
