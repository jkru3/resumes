At the intersection of technical problem-solving and creating exceptional human experiences is where I find purpose in my work. As a recent Computer Science graduate from the University of Washington, I've been exploring opportunities that align with my values. The Support Engineer role with Qualtrics' Digital Experience team resonates with me because it combines my technical capabilities with your mission to "bring humanity, connection, and empathy back to business". This is a principle that drove my work at Clearvote, where I built systems that connected over 3,000 users with critical information during election periods.

My experience designing scalable applications at Clean Power Research and supporting critical healthcare systems at MCG Health has taught me to dive deep beyond symptoms to address root causes. It's a skill essential for your Support Engineer position, and I've demonstrated the ability to remain composed under pressure while supporting mission-critical systems, automate solutions to recurring issues, and collaborate across engineering teams.

What attracts me to Qualtrics beyond the technical challenge is your approach to growth and team culture. Your commitment to dedicating 10\% of time to individual engineering growth and personalized Career Action Planning aligns with my philosophy of continuous development. I believe technology at its best serves human connection, and I'm excited about the prospect of contributing to that mission at Qualtrics. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my technical skills and problem-solving approach can support your Digital Experience team.
