\begin{itemize}
  \item Developed a multi-model pipeline using Zephyr-7b-beta that outperformed GPT-2 baselines on ProtoQA's commonsense reasoning benchmark through prompt engineering
  \item Optimized model performance with WordNet similarity matching and 30-token generation, without the need for fine-tuning
\end{itemize}
