# Mutable Resume Portfolio
Have you ever wanted to apply with a tailored resume, but found the process of editing, updating, and managing different resumes, frusterating?

Most resume generators focus on making one good resume. Anything more than that usually costs money in the form of a subscription. This is inconvenient for you as a job seeker because
1. Your resume changes over time
2. You need a way to manage multiple resumes to maximize their odds of standing out amoungst hundreds of applicants. i.e, you need a way *modularize* different skillsets to showcase for different positions
3. Sometimes downloading a file isn't the most convenient form. A lot of networking is done informally via links. Having more control over your own data isn't just better for your wallet, but helps make it easy to self host your resumes and share them (which this app is designed for)
4. You need something free to use. You are looking for a job, not trying to spend more money


Spinning up new custom tailored resumes fast, free, and easy. With just a VScode extension, you can writeup all your experiences as LaTeX modules and then make as many templates as you want, drag and dropping modules like legos to fit the needs of the job you are applying for. The best part? It's easy to save, store, and build upon all the templates you use as you improve it.

## Requirements
python 3.8+
run `brew install texlive`
install the 'LaTeX workshop' VScode extension

## Usage
Create resume templates and then save them. With LaTeX workshop, they are automatically compiled into PDFs

Deploying this through GitHub pages will allow you to refer to any of the PDFs in the ./build directory as a link, so anyone you want to share a tailored resume with can see it!

## Cover letters
Cover letters aren't a supported feature, but you want them since you are already invseting time into a targeted approach. 

I like to prompt an LLM with my resume and the job description, requesting it to write a cover letter. it goes something like this:
```
Here is my resume:
Here is my job:
Make me a narrative driven cover letter. Make me sound like a young upstart who they can see in themselves, and that whoever is reading this might want to take a chance on me.
```
